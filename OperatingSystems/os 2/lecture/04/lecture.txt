UNIX Shell scripts
------------------
* In UNIX any file can be executable if given the proper permissions

      chmod 700 a.sh

* Can I execute a text file? What would that mean? The file will be
  interpreted by the default shell (/bin/bash or other SHes)

  Other SHes: bash, sh (old and everywhere), csh, tcsh, ksh, zsh, ...

* A UNIX script is an ASCII file containing code that is interpretable
  by a program (shell, or possibly sed or awk or perl or python ...)

  How do we specify which such program should interpret it? Put the path
  to that program on the first line prefixed with #!

Control structures
------------------
* if, for, while, until, case

* They define sub-blocks similar to how it happens in C but they do not
  use curly brakets

* if ... then ... elif ... then ... else ... fi
* for ... do ... done
* while ... do ... done
* until ... do ... done
* case ... in ... esac

Shell Conditions
----------------
* You can find them all in "man test"

* string: -n - is not empty
          -z - is empty
          =  - equal
          != - not equal

* numbers -lt -le -eq -ge -gt

* files  -e - exists
         -r - readable
         -w - writable
         -x - exceutable
         -f - exists and it is a file
         -d - exists and it is a directory

FOR
---
* For cycles over a list of value. It is NOT similar to the C for
  instruction
* It is similar to foreach

Find the longest word in all the files in a given directory tree
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Concatenate all files into a single huge file, or if possible cycle
   through all files as if they were one
2. For each word calculate its lenth and print out something like this
   3 cat
   5 seven
   6 cowboy
3. Sort list reversly

Homework
--------
Given a text file, extract all the natural numbers (sequences of digits
without anything else) in that file and calculate their sum using a
Shell script
