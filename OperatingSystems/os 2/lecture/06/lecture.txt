EXEC
----

- mechanism for making other programs into processes

- works as a parasite

- as soon as it is called from a process (host), all the host's code
  disappears and it is replaced by the new program's code

- there are 6 versions of exec, that differ by:
  - how the path to the new program is given: absolute or relative
  - is the old environment kept or replaced by a new one
  - they way the new programs arguments are passed: array or simple
    parameter list
